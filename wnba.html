                <h4 style="padding-top: 1rem">Who Might Collect Relevant Data / What Articles or Publications Cite a Relevant Data Set?</h4>
                <p class="font-light">
                    The WNBA may already collect statistics and data regarding WNBA players, so I can possibly look on the WNBA website for more details. There are also other websites that are collecting data regarding WNBA players and those may also be useful when trying
                    to find the relevant data to answer these questions.

                    <b>Process for extracting, transforming, cleaning incoming data:</b>
                    <br> Columns that I plan on using are the Player Name, Year, Age, and Player Efficiency Rating columns from my dataset. The Player Name column is already a string which I need. The Year column is tricky, as it is a numerical type but
                    I still need it in the type of string as it is a categorical data type rather than a quantitative one. For Age and Player Efficiency Rating I will need to convert to Integer and Float types. There are some empty numerical cells for
                    players and those will be turned into 0 because in this case means that there are not statistics recorded for that player. It will show up as an empty string so it is necessary to fill in those cells. I also need to change some of
                    the data types for some columns. I'll use a generator to take in values from columns that I want. I will then put this data into a list where I can manipulate and hopefully answer the questions that I came up with.

                <p class="font-light">
                    In conclusion, I was able to answer 3/3 of my questions. For the 1st question, the answer to that is to use the mean() function and put PERS as the parameter. So mean(PERS) returned 11.900386299253112 which was the average Player Efficiency Rating in
                    the WNBA from 1997-2019. For the 2nd question, I was able to do the same thing as above and use mean(ages) to find the answer which is 26.29513262941025. For the last question, I can use max(PERS) to find the answer to that which is
                    78.9. For the rest of my analysis, I was able to also find an extension to my second question which is to find the average age of players per year in the WNBA from 1997-2019. Above is the graph for that and it shows that the average
                    age always hovers around 26. Overall, my analysis returned some pretty interesting statistics for WNBA players from 1997-2019.
