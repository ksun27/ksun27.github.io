                    Introduction

                <p class="font-light">
                    SwipeMe is SwipeMe is a web app whose purpose is to help bridge the gap between college students with an excess of meal swipes that go to waste (Swipers) and college students without a meal plan that would like to eat at dining halls at a discounted price
                    (Swipees).
                </p>
                <p class="font-light">
                    The web app operates primarily on a market-based interface. When a Swipee would like a meal, (s)he interacts with the web app to locate the nearest willing Swiper to the desired dining hall and communicate with him/her. Using a confirmation system, the
                    Swipee meets the Swiper at the desired dining hall. The Swiper swipes the Swipee and the Swipee pays the Swiper through SwipeMe.

                <h2 style="padding-top: 1rem">Ideation and Problem</h2>
                <p class="font-light">
                    This project was started in the summer of 2020 when me and my friend Ameya realized that there was an ongoing issue at New York University (NYU) where freshmen students had a significant amount of leftover meal swipes. With each meal swipe being valued
                    at around $11 to $12, and with some students with over 150 meal swipes left by the end of the semester, a significant amount of money and food are wasted each semester. After doing some market research among many of our freshmen friends,
                    we came to the realization that a simple way to solve this problem is to liquify leftover meal swipes. After doing some research, we found out that there were multiple attempts at giving away meal swipes as an incentive to not waste
                    food and meal swipes. However, we realized that these methodologies rarely gained traction as many times students are very lazy and do not have an incentive other than the motivation to not waste food. That’s when we came up with the
                    idea of SwipeMe, a project where users could sell their leftover meal swipes at a discounted price for other students to buy. This method would incentivize students with leftover meal swipes to actually go out and use their meal swipes
                    in exchange for a little bit of money. The buyer would be able to buy a meal much cheaper than the average New York City meal. Meal swipes would be saved from being wasted and food waste from dining halls can be minimized as there
                    would be more swipes being used.

                </p>
                <h2 style="padding-top: 1rem">Process</h2>
                <p class="font-light">
                    While this project is still a work in progress, my partner Ameya and I plan on finishing the project by Fall 2020. For our process, we are following a simple web app tech stack. For the front-end, we are using HTML, CSS, and JS. For our current setup,
                    we are prototyping our web pages with a CSS framework called Cirrus. Currently our backend consists of flask and SQL, where we are using flask to run the web framework we can use our SQL database. <br>Our approach
                    was to figure out core functionality; what would the website’s main functions be and how would we implement them. We came up with a few basic ideas where each user would have a profile page with different variables to determine each
                    user’s main attributes. For the attributes of each user, we came up with a marketplace concept where each user has the capability to become a seller or a buyer. </p>
                <p class="font-light">
                    For website flow, we wanted to have a singular page web app as the main portion of our project. The marketplace would show current listings of available sellers and have profile pages identifying the student that is selling. We would also have a login
                    and register page where students would have to prove that they are a NYU student that is willing to sell and buy meal swipes. Since we wanted our project to be exclusively for students at NYU, we also decided to come up with a profile
                    page where different users would be able to rate each other based on their experience with each other during the transaction. </p>
                <p class="font-light">
                    For the matching and confirmation portion of the project, we planned on implementing a system similar to Uber’s where sellers would only receive their payment after the swipe has been conducted and where the buyer would only pay once they had met up with
                    the seller. </p>
                <p class="font-light">
                    After determining our core functionality, we went to work in implementing the project. I am currently managing the front-end portion while my partner Ameya is working on the back-end.

                <h2 style="padding-top: 1rem">Design</h2>
                <p class="font-light">
                    As the front-end developer, for design, I wanted to have a preliminary sketch on how the website would actually look like in terms of our most ideal version. I used Figma to come up with different frames. Since this project is still a work in progress,
                    there are still a lot of core functionality designs that I still have not come up with, but here is what I have so far.
                </p>
                <figure class="fig">
                    <img class="img-stretch" src="SwipeMe - Register.png" />
                </figure>
                <p class="font-light">The register page identifies the user and requires them to input an NYU email to confirm that they are a student. An authentication email would then be sent to their NYU email that will confirm their enrollment at NYU.

                </p>
                <figure class="fig">
                    <img class="img-stretch" src="SwipeMe - Login updated.png" />
                </figure>
                <p class="font-light">The login page is a simple template; easy to read and straightforward.

                </p>
                <figure class="fig">
                    <img class="img-stretch" src="SwipeMe - Marketplace Concept.png" />
                </figure>
                <p class="font-light">The marketplace page features a list of different users who have put themselves available for buyers to select. As you select each user, their profile will show up on the right and display their name and their rating determined by previous
                    transactions. Users would then be able to check out with their selection and be sent to another page.

                </p>
                <p class="font-light">
                    Many designs have not been created as the project is still a work in progress, but I will continue to be updating my website as the project becomes more complete.

                </p>
                <h2 style="padding-top: 1rem">Current Progress</h2>
                <p class="font-light">
                    Our current progress is that we’ve successfully set up our database and have completed basic templates of our login, register, and main marketplace page. We are using the Cirrus CSS framework to help flesh out our templates for the login and register
                    pages. The marketplace page is still a very beta version where we will continue to be updating.

                <h2 style="padding-top: 1rem">Next Steps</h2>
                <p class="font-light">
                    Our next steps would be to implement a payment system, a location system, profile pages, and a confirmation system. We expect to complete our project by Fall 2020 and start testing by Spring 2021.
